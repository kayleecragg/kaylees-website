I loved Arcane S1 so much in 2021 that when the dates came out for S2 something compelled me to make this.

## Features
- Developed a Countdown website leading up to the 3 different acts of Arcane Season 2.
- Checks viewer's local timezone via Javascript and displays exactly what time the episodes will go live in their timezone.
- Allows users to check other timezones for when the episodes will go live.
- Responsive background feature that cycles through images and GIFs from the new trailers at random.

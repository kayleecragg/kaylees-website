![The checkerboard](/checkerboard.png)


- Developed a real-time tennis tournament checkerboard web application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript that aggregates live match data from a custom-made API (hosted on Vercel).
- Able to give notifications when a match changes court or players.
- Widely used by my companyâ€™s live operations team during large tennis tournaments to keep up to date on court and player changes, as well as to keep track of the matches on their assigned court.

WIP : MORE TO COME
